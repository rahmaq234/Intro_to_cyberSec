SECTION 1 
  WHAT I LEARNED 
Beyond the basic search techniques, Google offer specific terms known as "Advance operators" to help us perform advanced queries or searches, and when used properly they help us get the exact information we are looking for or narrows down our options so as to not waste time going through pages or websites.


SECTION 2
  OBJECTIVES I TICKED 
* Google Dork Is A Great Tool For OSINT: I had my first OSINT project, the outcome wasn't really that impressive to say the least, if I was aware of Google dork commands, it would have been great.
* Google Dorking Can Be Legal Or Illegal: depending on how you use it, Google dorking or Google hacking is not illegal if the technique is used to search for loopholes in apps or website an reporting them to the appropriate department. But if or when it is used for malicious act or to obtain data for exploitation then it's illegal depending on where you live 


SECTION 3
  OBJECTIVES I DIDN'T TICK 
As a student and cyber-security, and a novice in Google dorking, I have a lot to learn walking through my cyber journey. 


SECTION 4
   HELP 
I'll love to learn how to steer clear of malicious websites through my Google dork journey.
